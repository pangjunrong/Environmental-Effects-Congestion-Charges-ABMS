# Environmental Effects of Congestion Charges
## Using NetLogo 5.3 for Agent-Based Modelling & Simulation
This project explores the environmental implications of congestion charges, focusing on whether they inadvertently increase pollution by diverting traffic to arterial roads. Using agent-based modelling, we simulate traffic patterns and analyse the effects of congestion charges for different infrastructure scenarios. Our findings reveal a nuanced relationship: while congestion charges initially reduce CO2 emissions by easing expressway congestion, excessive congestion charges and additional traffic lights on arterial roads can worsen emissions due to increased idling and traffic oscillations. We subsequently conclude that optimal pricing and infrastructure management is critical to minimising environmental impact.
